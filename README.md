# Mapping_Earthquakes
Bootcamp Module 13: JS &amp; APIs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
To complete this projects, I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website using JavaScript and the D3.js library and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. After that, I added the retrieved data to a map using the Leaflet library to plot it on a Mapbox map through an API request thus creating interactivity for the data.

## Results
