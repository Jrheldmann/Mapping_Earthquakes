# Mapping_Earthquakes
Bootcamp Module 13: JS &amp; APIs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
To complete this project, I used a permalink for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website in conjunction with JavaScript to retrieve geographical coordinates regarding the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. I then added the retrieved data to a Mapbox-styled map using both the Leaflet and D3 JavaScript libraries to make the data interactable.

## Results
